## Welcome!
Do these phrases sound familiar to you? 
* "I'd love to watch this movie, too bad it isn't on one of the 25 streaming services I'm subscribed to." 
* "It's such a shame this piece of media is no longer available on legal services anymore."
* "I really want to play this game, but I don't want to support a corporation that sells me a $50 game and then sells me over [a thousand dollars worth of DLC](https://ibb.co/vj0wC9Y)."

Well, you've come to the right place. We're crossing over to the dark side, one that corporations are forcing us to with awful business practices and [stupidly expensive prices](https://www.thegamer.com/square-enix-70-price-pc/).

If you're new to piracy, by the end of this guide you'll be armed with hundreds of links to anything you could possibly want. You will be "that guy" in your friend group or family WhatsApp chat who can get anything for anyone. If you're a veteran pirate, stick around. You might find some links you've never heard of, or you might even be able to suggest some links to be added. Anything with a ⭐ is a program that I recommend. If you don't know what to pick, pick the one with the star.

## Need help? Have links I don't have?
If you need help with anything written here, or you have some links that I don't have, please contact me via Discord at HadesButDiscord#4177. I would love to hear anything you've got to say.

## What the hell is a torrent? And why should I use them?
In layman's terms, a torrent is a decentralised way of downloading things. Oh, who am I kidding, no-one will know what that means.

There are two main ways of downloading things on the internet.

### Direct Download
The first is a direct download (DDL). This one is the easiest, most common type of download across the general internet. Anytime you download something like Chrome or a VPN, you're using a DDL. The way a DDL works is one person has a file that they want to share. The person will upload the file to a central server (let's use Dropbox as an example) and everyone else will download the file from that central server. 

In terms of pirated content, these downloads don't need a VPN and can be downloaded from any common browser. Unfortunately, they can be taken down by copyright agencies and movie studios. They can also be slower and less reliable, as uploaders will turn to dodgier hosting sites to avoid the risk of a takedown. DDLs also don't have the capability of pausing and resuming after a power outage or connectivity problems.

### Torrent
The second is a torrent. Torrents are also fairly easy to use once everything is setup correctly, and are used for many things, not just piracy. Linux distributions and other open source software is often distributed via torrent along with a DDL. Torrents operate very differently to DDLs. This time, when one person has a file they want to share, they create a torrent, and upload a torrent file to another platform. The torrent file doesn't contain any of the actual file the person wants to send, it's just so the torrent client knows what to download. 

When the recipient starts downloading the torrent, it downloads directly from the person who shared it, completely bypassing the need for a central server. When the other person finishes downloading it, they start uploading it to anyone else who uses the torrent. This is known as seeding. When a lot of people start to seed the torrent, they eventually become faster and more reliable than a DDL. 

In terms of pirated content, torrents are heavily preferred. For starters, a torrent cannot be taken down. ***Ever.*** As long as at least one person is seeding the torrent, it will be available for download. Even if no one is seeding the torrent when you first try to download it, all it takes is for one person to boot up their PC with the torrent client open and that file to start uploading. Torrents are also capable of pausing and resuming after connectivity issues or a power outage, which is useful for long downloads.

Torrents, however, [***require a good, paid VPN.***](https://github.com/HadesButGithub/one-stop-piracy-shop#vpns) Without it, you may receive emails or letters from your ISP telling you to stop downloading torrents. You may even ***have your internet service temporarily suspended.*** As long as you have a good VPN, the chances of these things happening are very low. The chances are reduced even further to basically 0% if you follow this guide correctly.

### Which is best for me?
Both have their advantages and disadvantages. Which is best for you depends on your circumstances.

If you:
* Can afford a VPN (can be as little as $3 a month for a very fast VPN!)
* Don't mind leaving your computer on and seeding during the day
* Don't have a data cap on your internet plan
* Have 5 minutes or so to set a torrent client up
* Want the fastest speeds possible

Then torrents are for you. If you don't meet these requirements, stick to DDLs. Of course, you don't need to just use one or the other. Feel free to change between the two.

## Helpful Utilities
### VPNs
If you're torrenting, you need a VPN. Period. Without a VPN, your IP address is leaked to anyone downloading the torrent from you, which means two things. First, you could get DDoSed, or it could be used to gather information about you. Second, you'll probably get an email or letter from your ISP telling you to stop torrenting. This is more common. After a few emails and letters, it's possible that your ISP could temporarily or permanently suspend your internet service. Or you'll just get a heap of letters and that's not good for the environment (there's a great post on r/piracy where this guy has like 15 letters from comcast but i cant find it to link it here). A VPN can also be used to unblock DDL and streaming site that have been blocked by your ISP.

* [Windscribe](https://windscribe.com/) ⭐ - Fantastic, highly affordable VPN that works great for torrents. You can get one pro country and unlimited bandwidth across all servers for just $2USD a month with the [Build-A-Plan](https://windscribe.com/upgrade) tier. All servers (unless noted) work great for torrenting. Windscribe had over [55,000 requests](https://windscribe.com/transparency) for data in December of 2021 because of users torrenting content and complied with 0 of them because they didn't have any logs.
* [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) - High-speed Swiss VPN that safeguards your privacy. It gives you a free trial for a week when you download the app and login that can be easily abused by just creating more accounts. Use [GuerillaMail](https://www.guerrillamail.com/) to generate temporary emails for this. Includes servers optimised for torrents.
* [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/) - Experience the internet without anyone looking over your shoulder. Work, stream, and play safely with the world’s leading VPN. Includes servers that are optimised for torrents. 

### Adblocking 
Piracy websites tend to have a lot of ads, which are typically more invasive or malicious because of the sites illegal nature. Luckily, we can block them.

* [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin) ⭐ - An efficient blocker add-on for various browsers. Fast, potent, and lean. Blocks trackers, ads, pop-ups, everything. Amazing utility for desktop.
* [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/) - Browser with built in ad and tracker blocker. More suited for mobile users.

### Torrent Clients
* [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) ⭐ - The tagline for this software is "Free and reliable P2P Bittorrent client" and they're damn right. qBittorrent is fast, efficient, and feature-filled. I highly recommend this over any other program. Also contains a torrent search engine.
* [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/download/) - A Fast, Easy, and Free Bittorrent Client.

## Avoid these sites!!
Piracy can be dangerous. Not just legally, but in terms of viruses and other nasty programs that could end up on your PC or phone. To be extra safe, avoid these programs and sites.

* [The Pirate Bay](http://thepiratebay.org/) - One of the oldest names in the book, yet one of the most dangerous. TPB is filled with fake and malicious uploads and should never be used for software or games. Other types of media, like movies and TV, should be fine if you take [some steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/browsing_and_downloading_guide) to keep yourself safe from malware, but you should check other websites first.
* [SteamUnlocked](https://steamunlocked.net/) - After further research, I've deemed this site potentially malicious. Files provided by the site are generally safe, but ad redirects may contain malware. Download servers are also sketchy and slow, avoid if possible. If you can't find a game on any other site, come here as a last resort.
* IGGGames - Known for injecting their own DRM into games, and for extremely scummy practices, like doxxing the owner and forcing the shutdown of GoodOldDownloads, one of the best DDL game sites. IGGGames releases are safe to download on 1337x however.
* uTorrent - What used to be one of the best torrent clients is now one you should steer clear of. They have been caught bundling malicious programs like cryptominers and adware into the installer, and the client has ads.
* uTorrent Web - Owned by the same company as uTorrent.
* Bittorrent - Owned by the same company as uTorrent.
* BitLord Torrent Client - Malware
* Soda Stream - Malware
* Sidify - Says they can download from Spotify, but it just downloads from YouTube and gets metadata from other places.
* Allavsoft - Same as Sidify.
* PeerBlock - Claims to block copyright notices, but it doesn't work. Use a VPN.

## Movies and TV
### Streaming Sites
* [Soap2Day](https://soapgate.org/) ⭐ - Heaps of HD content, no VPN required, super fast load times. 
* [LookMovie](https://lookmovie.io/) - HD streaming servers, decently fast loading times. Has cam rips if you desperately want a new release.
* [Streamlord](http://www.streamlord.com/index.html) - Nice interface, very fast servers and HD content. Slightly familiar orange and black colour scheme.

### DDL
* [DDLValley](https://www.ddlvalley.me/) - General purpose DDL site that happens to contain movies and TV shows. Torrents are recommended if you can use them.

### Torrents ([VPN required](https://github.com/HadesButGithub/one-stop-piracy-shop#vpns))
* [RARBG](http://rarbg.to/index80.php) ⭐ - General purpose torrent site, but very good for movies and TV shows.
* [YTS](https://yts.mx) ⭐ - High resolution Bluray and web movie rips at very small file sizes (compared to other HD rips).
* [EZTV](https://eztv.re/) - Large collection of TV torrents.

## Games
### Windows
* [FitGirl Repacks](https://fitgirl-repacks.site/) ⭐ - PC games that have been heavily compressed. This will save time on the download, but the game will be the same size as a normal install after it finishes installing, and the install procedure will take significantly longer. Heaps of games though, including Switch games with an emulator ready to go included in all of them. *Most, if not all, downloads use torrents along side DDLs. Use a VPN when torrenting.*
* [SteamRip](https://steamrip.com) ⭐ - A safe alternative to SteamUnlocked. Much faster downloads that typically use the full capabilities of your internet connection. *Some downloads use torrents. Use a VPN when torrenting.*
* [DODI Repacks](https://dodi-repacks.site/) - Same concept as FitGirl. Slightly bigger repacks but faster install time. Also has Switch games. *Most, if not all, downloads use torrents along side DDLs. Use a VPN when torrenting.*
* [1337x](http://1337x.to/) - General torrent site, great for games. Contains releases from the Scene and from repackers like DODI and FitGirl. *All downloads use torrents. Use a VPN when torrenting.*
* [Masquerade Repacks](https://masquerade.site/) - Same as DODI and FitGirl. Includes repacks of Xbox 360 games with emulators. *Uses torrents alongside Google Drive and other DDL links. Use a VPN when torrenting.*
* [GamesDrive](https://gamesdrive.net) - Forum for game cracks. Requires JDownloader to download games. Instructions are on game releases. *DDL only.*
* [Steam Underground - cs.rin.ru](https://cs.rin.ru/) - Very reputable forum for game cracks. Website appears to be in Russian at first, translate the page to English and sign up for an account. You'll be brought to an English forum which you can use to download your games.
### Nintendo Switch
These games can be downloaded and played through an emulator or on a Switch that has had CFW installed. Check out [r/SwitchPirates](https://reddit.com/r/SwitchPirates) for more information on using CFW to pirate games. If using an emulator, see if FitGirl or DODI has a repack first, as it will be significantly easier to setup.

* [nsw2u](https://nsw2u.xyz/) ⭐ - Contains heaps of Switch games. Some downloads use torrents, these are indicated on the cover art of the game. You may need to disconnect from your VPN to get into the website because of the DDoS protection. Just remember to completely quit your torrent client before doing this, and turn it back on before downloading any torrents from the site.
* [Softcobra](https://www.softcobra.com/ntdo/ntdo-swh/swh-nsp-collection/) - Switch games again. All the links will need to be decoded through the [Nin10news decoder](https://nin10news.com/decode/). Check nsw2u before using this site. *Most, if not all, downloads use torrents. Use a VPN when torrenting.*

### PS4
PS4 emulation is currently unusable, difficult to setup, only works on Linux, and requires a modded PS4. These downloads are for people on a PS4 with CFW. I have not tested any of these links. These may or may not use torrents.

* [Auctor](https://auctor.tv/category/ps4/)
* [PKGPS4](https://www.pkgps4.com/)
* [PS4ISO](https://www.ps4iso.net/)

### Retro
This is just assorted retro downloads. You'll need an emulator like [RetroArch](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1118310/RetroArch/) to use these downloads.
* [Vimm's Lair](https://vimm.net) ⭐ - Complete collections of a lot of consoles. Original Xbox, DS, PS1, PS2, and heaps more. Too many to list.
* [Retrostic](https://www.retrostic.com/) - Has more consoles and faster downloads, but the collections aren't complete.
