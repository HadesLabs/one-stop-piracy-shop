## Welcome!
Do these phrases sound familiar to you? 
* "I'd love to watch this movie, too bad it isn't on one of the 25 streaming services I'm subscribed to." 
* "It's such a shame this piece of media is no longer available on legal services anymore."
* "I really want to play this game, but I don't want to support a corporation that sells me a $50 game and then sells me over [a thousand dollars worth of DLC](https://ibb.co/vj0wC9Y)."

Well, you've come to the right place. We're crossing over to the dark side, one that corporations are forcing us to with awful business practices and [stupidly expensive prices](https://www.thegamer.com/square-enix-70-price-pc/).

If you're new to piracy, by the end of this guide you'll be armed with hundreds of links to anything you could possibly want. You will be "that guy" in your friend group or family WhatsApp chat who can get anything for anyone. If you're a veteran pirate, stick around. You might find some links you've never heard of, or you might even be able to suggest some links to be added. Anything with a ⭐ is a program that I recommend. If you don't know what to pick, pick the one with the star.

## Need help? Have links I don't have?
If you need help with anything written here, or you have some links that I don't have, please contact me via Discord at HadesButDiscord#4177. I would love to hear anything you've got to say.

## What the hell is a torrent? And why should I use them?
In layman's terms, a torrent is a decentralised way of downloading things. Oh, who am I kidding, no-one will know what that means.

There are two main ways of downloading things on the internet.

### Direct Download
The first is a direct download (DDL). This one is the easiest, most common type of download across the general internet. Anytime you download something like Chrome or a VPN, you're using a DDL. The way a DDL works is one person has a file that they want to share. The person will upload the file to a central server (let's use Dropbox as an example) and everyone else will download the file from that central server. 

In terms of pirated content, these downloads don't need a VPN and can be downloaded from any common browser. Unfortunately, they can be taken down by copyright agencies and movie studios. They can also be slower and less reliable, as uploaders will turn to dodgier hosting sites to avoid the risk of a takedown. DDLs also don't have the capability of pausing and resuming after a power outage or connectivity problems.

### Torrent
The second is a torrent. Torrents are also fairly easy to use once everything is setup correctly, and are used for many things, not just piracy. Linux distributions and other open source software is often distributed via torrent along with a DDL. Torrents operate very differently to DDLs. This time, when one person has a file they want to share, they create a torrent, and upload a torrent file to another platform. The torrent file doesn't contain any of the actual file the person wants to send, it's just so the torrent client knows what to download. 

When the recipient starts downloading the torrent, it downloads directly from the person who shared it, completely bypassing the need for a central server. When the other person finishes downloading it, they start uploading it to anyone else who uses the torrent. This is known as seeding. When a lot of people start to seed the torrent, they eventually become faster and more reliable than a DDL. 

In terms of pirated content, torrents are heavily preferred. For starters, a torrent cannot be taken down. ***Ever.*** As long as at least one person is seeding the torrent, it will be available for download. Even if no one is seeding the torrent when you first try to download it, all it takes is for one person to boot up their PC with the torrent client open and that file to start uploading.

Torrents, however, ***require a good, paid VPN.*** Without it, you may receive emails or letters from your ISP telling you to stop downloading torrents. You may even ***have your internet service temporarily suspended.*** As long as you have a good VPN, the chances of these things happening are very low. The chances are reduced even further to basically 0% if you follow this guide correctly.

### Which is best for me?
Both have their advantages and disadvantages. Which is best for you depends on your circumstances.

If you:
* Can afford a VPN (can be as little as $3 a month for a very fast VPN!)
* Don't mind leaving your computer on and seeding during the day
* Don't have a data cap on your internet plan
* Have 5 minutes or so to set a torrent client up
* Want the fastest speeds possible

Then torrents are for you. If you don't meet these requirements, stick to DDLs. Of course, you don't need to just use one or the other. Feel free to change between the two.

## VPNs
If you're torrenting, you need a VPN. Period. Without a VPN, your IP address is leaked to anyone downloading the torrent from you, which means two things. First, you could get DDoSed, or it could be used to gather information about you. Second, you'll probably get an email or letter from your ISP telling you to stop torrenting. This is more common. After a few emails and letters, it's possible that your ISP could temporarily or permanently suspend your internet service. Or you'll just get a heap of letters and that's not good for the environment (there's a great post on r/piracy where this guy has like 15 letters from comcast but i cant find it to link it here).
