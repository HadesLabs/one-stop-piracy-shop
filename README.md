## Welcome!
Do these phrases sound familiar to you? 
* "I'd love to watch this movie, too bad it isn't on one of the 25 streaming services I'm subscribed to." 
* "It's such a shame this piece of media is no longer available on legal services anymore."
* "I really want to play this game, but I don't want to support a corporation that sells me a $50 game and then sells me over [a thousand dollars worth of DLC](https://ibb.co/vj0wC9Y)."

Well, you've come to the right place. We're crossing over to the dark side, one that corporations are forcing us to with awful business practices and [stupidly expensive prices](https://www.thegamer.com/square-enix-70-price-pc/).

If you're new to piracy, by the end of this guide you'll be armed with hundreds of links to anything you could possibly want. You will be "that guy" in your friend group or family WhatsApp chat who can get anything for anyone. If you're a veteran pirate, stick around. You might find some links you've never heard of, or you might even be able to suggest some links to be added.

## What the hell is a torrent? And why should I use them?
In layman's terms, a torrent is a decentralised way of downloading things. Oh, who am I kidding, no-one will know what that means.

There are two main ways of downloading things on the internet.

### Direct Download
The first is a direct download (DDL). This one is the easiest, most common type of download across the general internet. Anytime you download something like Chrome or a VPN, you're using a DDL. The way a DDL works is one person has a file that they want to share. The person will upload the file to a central server (let's use Dropbox as an example) and everyone else will download the file from that central server. 

In terms of pirated content, these downloads don't need a VPN and can be downloaded from any common browser. Unfortunately, they can be taken down by copyright agencies and movie studios. They can also be slower and less reliable, as uploaders will turn to dodgier hosting sites to avoid the risk of a takedown. DDLs also don't have the capability of pausing and resuming after a power outage or connectivity problems.

### Torrent
The second is a torrent. Torrents are also fairly easy to use once everything is setup correctly, and are used for many things, not just piracy. Linux distributions and other open source software is often distributed via torrent along with a DDL. Torrents operate very differently to DDLs. This time, when one person has a file they want to share, they create a torrent, and upload a torrent file to another platform. The torrent file doesn't contain any of the actual file the person wants to send, it's just so the torrent client knows what to download. 

When the recipient starts downloading the torrent, it downloads directly from the person who shared it, completely bypassing the need for a central server. When the other person finishes downloading it, they start uploading it to anyone else who uses the torrent. This is known as seeding. When a lot of people start to seed the torrent, they eventually become faster and more reliable than a DDL.
